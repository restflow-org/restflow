   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

JUnit

Common Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

      i) changes to the Program, and

      ii) additions to the Program;

      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
not derivative works of the Program. 

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder. 

      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by
any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
acquire that license before distributing the Program.

      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
set forth in this Agreement. 

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
its own license agreement, provided that:

      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

      b) its license agreement:

      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
and fitness for a particular purpose; 

      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits; 

      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on
or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

When the Program is made available in source code form:

      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 

      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program. 

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise
of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of
the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to
the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
in any resulting litigation.

Any republication or derived work distributed in source code form
must include this copyright and license notice.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE 
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY C
OPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS 
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. 

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO 
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS 
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 

1. Definitions 
a."Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or 
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with 
a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works

a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) 
for the purposes of this License. 
b."Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and 
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, 
dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, 
art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the 
Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that 
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for 
the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a 
musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in 
timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a 
Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
c."Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the 
terms of this License. 
d."Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work. 
e."Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms 
of this License. 
f."You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who 
has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, 
or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights 
under this License despite a previous violation. 

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or 
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on 
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other 
applicable laws. 

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual 
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights 
in the Work as stated below: 
a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective 
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; 
b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works; 
c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, 
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including 
as incorporated in Collective Works; 
d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, 
and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works. 
e.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
i.Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive 
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society 
(e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public 
digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
ii.Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive 
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or 
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You 
create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the 
compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or 
the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

f.Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where 
the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, 
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), 
royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, 
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US 
Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known 
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such 
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other 
media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby 
reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made 
subject to and limited by the following restrictions: 
a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly 
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You 
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License 
with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, 
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose 
any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the 
recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense 
the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to 
the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, 
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any 
technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner 
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to 
the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the 
Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of 
this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor 
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit
as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the 
Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. 
b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally 
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep 
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the 
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or 
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author 
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, 
publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, 
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or 
parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably 
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies 
to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the 
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of 
a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative 
Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or 
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be 
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a 
Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where 
any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as 
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. 

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS 
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND 
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER 
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT 
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, 
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS 
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

7. Termination 
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities 
who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this 
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such 
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. 
Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. 
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is 
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). 
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work 
under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; 
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this 
License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted 
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full 
force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 

8. Miscellaneous 
a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a 
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the 
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under 
this License. 
b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, 
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same 
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. 
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the 
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach 
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by 
the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. 
e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements 
or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor 
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any 
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual 
written agreement of the Licensor and You.

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under 
the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic 
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via 
Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it 
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular 
Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code 
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 

3.3. Description of Modifications
 
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to 
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the 
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and 
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable 
version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
 
3.4.a. Third Party Claims: If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual 
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, 
Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the 
claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If 
Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, 
Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and 
shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to 
inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 

3.4.b. Contributor APIs: If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and 
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, 
Contributor must also include this information in the legal file. 

3.4.c. Representations: Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, 
Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or 
Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.5. Required Notices
 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such 
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location 
(such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or 
more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must 
also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or 
ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do 
so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it 
absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, 
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by 
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You 
offer. 

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions
 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 
and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version 
of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where 
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice 
in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights 
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights 
under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in 
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. 
If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any 
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.7. Larger Works
 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this 
License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the 
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of 
the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of 
this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such 
description must be included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all 
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description 
must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 

5. Application of this License.
 
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to 
related Covered Code. 

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions
 
The H2 Group may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be 
given a distinguishing version number. 

6.2. Effect of New Versions
 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to 
use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any 
subsequent version of the License published by the H2 Group. No one other than the H2 Group has the right to 
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 

6.3. Derivative Works
 
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code 
which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the 
phrases "H2 Group", "H2" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that 
your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license 
contains terms which differ from the H2 License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code 
or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of 
this License.) 

7. Disclaimer of Warranty
 
Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either 
expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of defects, 
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and 
performance of the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you 
(not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair or 
correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered 
code is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer. 

8. Termination
 
8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with 
terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to 
the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, 
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment 
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You 
file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that: 

8.2.a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all 
rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days 
notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: 
(i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use 
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the 
Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment 
arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, 
the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the 
expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 

8.2.b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or 
indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 
2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, 
Modifications made by that Participant. 

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's 
Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by 
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value 
of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in 
determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding 
distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to 
termination shall survive termination. 

9. Limitation of Liability
 
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or 
any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work 
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such 
party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not 
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent 
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you. 

10. United States Government End Users
 
The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (October 1995), 
consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such terms 
are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (September 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set 
forth herein. 

11. Miscellaneous
 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this 
License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law,
if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at
least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in United States of
America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts 
of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing 
party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and 
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 
is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be 
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 

12. Responsibility for Claims
 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, 
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with 
Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 

13. Multiple-Licensed Code
 
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" 
means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of 
this or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in 
Exhibit A. 

Exhibit A
 Multiple-Licensed under the H2 License, Version 1.0,
and under the Eclipse Public License, Version 1.0
(http://h2database.com/html/license.html).
Initial Developer: H2 Group

 Eclipse Public License - Version 1.0
 
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, 
REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

1. DEFINITIONS
 
"Contribution" means: 

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this 
Agreement, and 

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 

i) changes to the Program, and 

ii) additions to the Program; 

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular 
Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to 
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under 
their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. 

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use 
or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. 

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement. 

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, 
worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative 
works, in source code and object code form. 

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, 
worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and 
otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This 
patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the 
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be 
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include 
the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth 
herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other 
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for 
claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a 
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole 
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party 
patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to 
acquire that license before distributing the Program. 

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, 
if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 

3. REQUIREMENTS
 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, 
provided that: 

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 

b) its license agreement: 

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, 
including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect,
special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; 

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and
not
by any other party; and 

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to 
obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

When the Program is made available in source code form: 

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. 

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that 
reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business 
partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the 
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a 
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and 
indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs 
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial 
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged 
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify 
the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and 
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The 
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That 
Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, 
or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial 
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend 
claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court 
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those 
damages. 

5. NO WARRANTY
 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the 
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not 
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, 
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY 
LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT 
LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF 
THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. 

7. GENERAL
 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the 
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the 
parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
and enforceable. 

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or 
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material 
terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after 
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient 
agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's 
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue 
and survive. 

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency 
the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves 
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other 
than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial 
Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward 
to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version 
number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, 
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. 
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to 
the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, 
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. 

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the 
United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more 
than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting
litigation. 

Export Control Classification Number (ECCN)
 
As far as we know, the U.S. Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for this software is 5D002. However,
for legal reasons, we can make no warranty that this information is correct. For details, see also the Apache
Software Foundation Export Classifications page.

JPython 1.1.x Software License.
 
1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Corporation for National Research 
Initiatives, having an office at 1895 Preston White Drive, Reston, VA 20191 
("CNRI"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and using 
JPython version 1.1.x in source or binary form and its associated 
documentation as provided herein ("Software").
 
2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, CNRI 
hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, 
world-wide license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display 
publicly, prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use the

B. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
 
JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the primary 
developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw took over as 
primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.
 
In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge where it was 
renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed under the Jython 
specific license below.
 
From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed Python Software 
Foundation contributor agreements and releases are covered under the Python 
Software Foundation license version 2.
 
The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation license 
as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.
 
The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed under 
the GNU Public License. The package is now covered by the Jython Software 
License.
 
The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software License. 
See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.
